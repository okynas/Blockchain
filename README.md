## About crypto:

### What does a "Block" look like:

This is a block: 

```
block = {
  'index': 1,
  'timestamp': 1506057125.900785,
  'transactions': [
    {
      'sender': "8527147fe1f5426f9dd545de4b27ee00",
      'recipient': "a77f5cdfa2934df3954a5c7c7da5df1f",
      'amount': 5,
    }
  ],
  'proof': 324984774000,
  'previous_hash': "2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824"
}
```

Each of them have an index, timestamp, list of transactions, proof and hash.

That means that each new block contains within itself, hash of the previous block.
THIS is what gives blockchain immutability, can't be changed.

That means, if a block is corrupted, then all blocks that follows will be corrupt.

### How does the proof work:

Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm, is the way that new block is being created, or mined.
The meaning by PoW is to discover a number, that solves a problem.

It should be easily verified, but not so easy to find.

In Bitcoin the algorithm is called Hashcash.

### Our Algorithm:

Find a number "p" that when hashed with the previous blockâ€™s solution a hash with 4 leading '0s' is produced.

### Problem of Consensus
Problem of Consensus is a problem that occur when a blockchain is decentralized, as it should, and should point to the same chain. 
The problem occur when we have more than one node.

### URLS:

- GET /mine
- POST /transactions/new
- GET /chain
- POST /nodes/register
- GET /nodes/resolve

### Function descriptions

new_block()
- create a new block that will be added on the blockchain

new_transaction()
- sends a block from node A to node B

register_node()
- add a new node to the network / list of nodes

valid_chain()
- check that the hash of all block is correct
- check that the PoW works for all blocks

resolve_conflict()
- fixes error where pushing multiple block to the blockchain from different nodes. 
- make sure that every node on the blockchain is updated when node A pushes to the blockchain

proof_of_work(old_proof)
- checking the old proof and combining with the new proof
- updates new proof for newly mined block.

last_block() - method
- returns last block in the blockchain

hash() - static
- create a hash of that block

verify_proof() - static
- checking two proofs up against eachother, and checking if the ending is "0000"
